# PhosphorOS
An OS I wrote in C <br>
<!----><br>
**NOTE:** It has come to my attention that this has gotten more attention than my other project [CLIBASIC](https://github.com/pqcraft/clibasic), which I have spent a *lot* more time and effort on, please also give it a try :) <!-- Also someone un-starred it :( --> <br>
<!----><br>
**NOTE:** Development is now sort of suspended until I can find out how to read from at least the CD and floppy.
<!----><br>
**NOTE:** Development is now indefinitely suspended as I have switched to an Arch-based Linux distro and PhOS refuses to compile unless `-fno-stack-protector` is added to the build options, but when I add this option the OS will refuse to boot with an 'Illegal Instruction' fault.
